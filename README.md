<p> Jupyter Notebook - Bangkok Traffic/ Accident Monitoring </p><br />

<b>Preamble:</b><br />

<p>Traffic in Bangkok is undisputed one of the worst in the world. To commute or travel in this big city, people commonly spend at least two  to four hours a day to travel to work and back home daily. Goal of this project is to gather the reported accidents and traffic condition by the Twitter users on each day and present them on the map so we could use this in trip planning. Hopefully this could help shorten the travel time. </p>
